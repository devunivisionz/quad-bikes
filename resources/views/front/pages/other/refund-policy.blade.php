It is applicable to all guests who make a tour reservation on the Quads Dubai website. If a guest encounters any tour & travel problem, we will generally, at our discretion, do any of the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Recompense you up to the tour price paid by you, however, depending on the type or extent of the travel issue suffered.</li>
                <li>Exercise reasonable effort to provide you with an alternative that is judiciously similar to the tours or packages mentioned in your original booking.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>While we’ll do everything possible to reimburse the amount if you need to cancel a tour or package booked through the Quads Dubai website, it is vital to note that we’re subject to different set of policies when it comes to private contract.
